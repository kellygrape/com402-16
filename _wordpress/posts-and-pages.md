###Post vs Page

The basic content types in Wordpress are posts and pages.  They serve very different functions.

[Post vs. Page from Wordpress.com](https://en.support.wordpress.com/post-vs-page/)

Here are some things you can consider when deciding if your content is better suited for a post or for a page

- Is the content relatively static (won't change often)?  **Page**
- Is the content typical of a blog entry? **Post**	 
- Will the article be archived and remain on your site so that it can be searched for later? **Post**
- Is this content like what you'd find on typical Contact or About pages? **Page**
- Is the date you published the information relevant to the user or relevant to how you organize the different articles? **Post** 
- Is the article newsworthy? **Post**
- Does the information included in the article fall into different categories and can those categories be organized or searched for independently? Does it have to be categorized? **Post**
- Must the layout of the content be controlled by a template?  **Page**

###Page of Posts

By default, Wordpress is configured to show a listing of your posts as the main "page" of your website.  If you would like something different on your homepage (perhaps you would like a special layout, or a more static front page), you can create that in the Settings->Reading section of the dashboard.

If you choose to go this route (you will be required to do this for your final project), you also need to create a **Posts Page**.  The most basic method for doing this is to create a New Page, name it something like "Posts" or "News" or "Blog" (the title of the page doesn't really matter!).  Leave the page blank.  The, in the Settings->Reading section of the dashboard, choose this page that you just created as the "Posts Page" for your site.  Your newly created page should now list your posts.

This can get a bit different - some templates have different ways of dealing with posts pages.  [Read more about creating a posts page](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-create-a-separate-page-for-blog-posts-in-wordpress/)
