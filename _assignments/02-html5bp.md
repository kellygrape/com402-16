##Coding Assignment #2 - HTML5 Boilerplate

*Assigned : 02/04/2016*
*Due: 02/09/2016*

### Assignment (Due Tuesday, February 9)

- Explore the HTML5 Boilerplate template you have downloaded
  
  - Change the color scheme
  - Change the text
  - Add a logo instead of the text
  - Add Google Web Fonts

- Experiment with the provided media queries

  - can you change the header color when the browser is over 700px?

Once you have had a chance to experiment with HTML5BP, **use what you have created to complete the following**.

- Create a three-page website
- Your website should have a homepage and two sub-pages
- Your **sidebar** (`<aside>`) should include your **Name** and a short "About Me" (try to get it under 140 characters - think along the lines of a twitter bio, like [@saintjosephs](https://twitter.com/saintjosephs) *"The official account of SJU, Philadelphia's Jesuit University. Founded in 1851. live greater. that's the magis."*).  If you want to include an image, feel free to do so.
- Your **menu** should link to your homepage and to the two sub-pages
- Your homepage should include an image (check out [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for some great imagery.  *Be sure to properly cite your image!*
- Your two pages should include your responses to two [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/).  Read at least the titles of each one.  Choose two and write a 150-300 word response for each one.  My suggestions are below, but you can choose whatever you would like.

  - [Myth #4: Design is about making a website look good](http://uxmyths.com/post/654070104/myth-design-is-about-making-a-website-look-good)
  - [Myth #9: Design has to be original](http://uxmyths.com/post/712377283/myth-9-design-has-to-be-original)
  - [Myth #17: The homepage is your most important page](http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page)
  - [Myth #19: You donâ€™t need the content to design a website](http://uxmyths.com/post/718187422/myth-you-dont-need-the-content-to-design-a-website)
  - [Myth #28: White space is wasted space](http://uxmyths.com/post/2059998441/myth-28-white-space-is-wasted-space)
