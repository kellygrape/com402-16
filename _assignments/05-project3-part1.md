## Personal Website / Portfolio

Complete and launch a 4 or 5 page personal website / portfolio.  This can be launched on GitHub or in Reclaim Hosting.

 - You may use a template from [HTML5Up](http://html5up.net/) or [Templated.Co](http://templated.co/).  Some of the templates are designed especially for **single page websites**.  Since your project needs to be 4 or 5 pages, if you want to use one of those templates you will need to figure out a creative way to make it multi-page.  

  - If you want to use GitHub to launch this rather than using Reclaim Hosting, you will need to follow the instructions for a [Github Pages **user** site](https://pages.github.com/).  I can help with this.  

  - If you are uploading to Reclaim Hosting, the website should live at your root (so when you go to http://mywebsite.com, your website will show).

  - If you want to make a website about something different, please run it by the professor first.

### File Organization

- Create a new folder in your document root.  Name it whatever you would like (I suggest `personalsite` or `portfolio` or something similar)
- In this folder, build your application.  You should have at minimum an index.html, three additional HTML files, and organized stylesheets and scripts.  If you are using images, they should also be organized.


### Things to Pay Attention To

#### Code

- Comments in HTML, CSS, and Javascript are encouraged where relevant!
- Your code should be clean and well organized.  Nested tags should have proper tabbing and code should be spaced to make it as readable as possible.
- All your links should work! Make sure external links, images, etc are all functioning.
- Your code should all validate!

#### Design and Content:

- Site navigation should be straightforward and consistent.  I should be able to access each main page from every other page.  The only exception to this would be, for example, if you're making a gallery that you can click on each item to get to another page about that item ... those secondary pages can be linked to only from the gallery.
- Images should be properly compressed and sized for web. In most cases they'll be smaller than 1MB each.
- All CSS and Javascript / JQuery should function and work as intended.
- All of the content included on your site should be complete. No lorem ipusm or placeholder images.

### How will you grade this?

This is worth 60% of Project 2.  25 Points total broken into the points below.

| Points | Note |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| 10 Points | Thoughtful and creative implementation of a web application / web page using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. |
| 3 Points | HTML and CSS Validate.   If you are using a pre-built template, such as one of the CoDrops examples, your CSS may not completely validate (sometimes they are using experimental CSS techniques that might not be fully valid) but your CSS should be free of errors. |
| 10 Points | Thoughtful use of color, styling, whitespace, and typography (utilize external fonts from Google Web Fonts or other web font resources as needed) |
| 2 points | Submitted on time |


## Delivery 

This should be submitted as a **web link**.  If you are launching this on Reclaim Hosting, I will need you to either send me a zip file with your code or a link to a github repository.  If you are launching this on GitHub, I will be able to see the code directly.
