##UX/UI Challenge

We've learned a little about UX and UI in this class.  I'd like you to think about **tools that you use at SJU**, specifically online tools.  Is there a tool you use that you think has a good user experience?  What about a tool with a user experience that could be improved?

A tool, for the purposes of this project, is **something web-based that you use to accomplish a task**.  It must be something that is provided by SJU (something in the Nest, something you use for a class ... etc).

For example, as a faculty member, I am able to quickly access a class list using the Nest.  My user experience could be improved, because the button that I use to access the class list is not clearly labelled.


### Good Examples

Think about a tool with a good user experience.
  
- Write a 500 word essay about a tool with a good user experience.
- You can include screenshots of the tool.
- Write your essay using Google Docs or Microsoft Word

### Bad Example and Redesign

Think about a tool with a user experience that could be improved.  

- Create a **prototype** redesign of this tool
- Do NOT use HTML or CSS
- Use a tool such as [moqups](https://moqups.com/), [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/), or any other drawing tool that you wish.  Your mockup / prototype does not need to be perfect, but it should get your point across.
- Write a 250 word essay that explains your mockup / prototype, and the improvements you are recommending to the current tool.
- Write your essay using Google Docs or Microsoft Word.  Include your mockup and a screenshot of the tool you are improving.

### Delivery

This part of the project will be due **Thursday, April 7**.  You should email it to me at kpipe@sju.edu
