## GitHub Pages for Projects & API App

Utilize GitHub Pages to create a simple project website.  

You will be completing our API project, styling it, and upload it to GitHub.  We will walk though this process in class.  [Instructions](https://pages.github.com/).

### How will you grade this?

This is worth 40% of Project 2.  25 Points total broken into the points below.

| Points | Note |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| 10 Points | Thoughtful and creative implementation of a web application / web page using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. |
| 3 Points | HTML and CSS Validate.   If you are using a pre-built template, such as one of the CoDrops examples, your CSS may not completely validate (sometimes they are using experimental CSS techniques that might not be fully valid) but your CSS should be free of errors. |
| 10 Points | Thoughtful use of color, styling, whitespace, and typography (utilize external fonts from Google Web Fonts or other web font resources as needed) |
| 2 points | Submitted on time |
