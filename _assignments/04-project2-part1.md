##Javascript / jQuery Project

Use jQuery or Javascript to create a simple, interactive tool or webpage.

**Option 1**

Utilize jQuery to create a simple tic-tac-toe game.  The game does not need to determine a winner. [This is an example of what I mean, using HTML and CSS -- this one determines a winner, but you do not need to implement that](http://codepen.io/ziga-miklic/pen/Fagmh).  This is not a valid solution, just an example.

**Option 2**

Utilize jQuery / Javascript to create a “Frequently Asked Questions” list, consisting of a list of at least 10 questions and their answers.  The answer should be hidden and should only be shown when you click on each question (or whatever element you want to use for the showing).

**Option 3**

Utilize jQuery / Javascript to create a web page that has different styles when the lights go on or off.  You should be changing colors and hiding / showing elements.  [This is an example of what I mean, using HTML and CSS](http://codepen.io/DKunin/pen/dAhmg).  This is not a valid solution, just an example.

**Option 4**

An idea of your choosing.  Check with the teacher first.


###File Organization

- Create a new folder in your document root.  Call it **project2**
- In your **project2** folder, create another folder.  Call it **part1**
- In your **part1** folder, build your application.  You should have at minimum an index.html, and organized stylesheets and scripts.  If you are using images, they should also be organized.

###How will you grade this?

This is worth 30% of Project 2.  20 Points total broken into the points below.

| Points | Note |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 points | jQuery is included correctly (if using jQuery). Scripts are written in a separate file and linked to the HTML file. |
| 3 points | Thoughtful use of color, whitespace, and typography (utilize external fonts from Google Web Fonts or other web font resources as needed) |
| 5 points | Application utilizes javscript or jquery to create at least two different interactions (example - toggling something on and off would count as two interactions) |
| 3 points | HTML and CSS validate. Uses appropriate, semantic HTML and CSS. |
| 3 points | Files are organized in a logical manner |
| 3 points | Submitted on time |
