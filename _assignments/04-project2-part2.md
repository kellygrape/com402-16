## jQuery Plugin

Utilizing an already-created jQuery plugin, make your own web page / web application.  You may also choose one of the tutorials / samples Iâ€™ve given from codrops and use that as a base for your own project.

### Plugin Examples

These are intended as examples of scripts you can use.  You may choose your own.

### File Organization

- Create a new folder in your document root.  Call it **project2**  (you might have already created this for part 1)
- In your **project2** folder, create another folder.  Call it **part2**
- In your **part2** folder, build your application.  You should have at minimum an index.html, and organized stylesheets and scripts.  If you are using images, they should also be organized.

### How will you grade this?

This is worth 30% of Project 2.  25 Points total broken into the points below.

| Points | Note |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| 10 Points | Thoughtful and creative implementation of a web application / web page using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. |
| 3 Points | HTML and CSS Validate.   If you are using a pre-built template, such as one of the CoDrops examples, your CSS may not completely validate (sometimes they are using experimental CSS techniques that might not be fully valid) but your CSS should be free of errors. |
| 10 Points | Thoughtful use of color, styling, whitespace, and typography (utilize external fonts from Google Web Fonts or other web font resources as needed) |
| 2 points | Submitted on time |

This should be submitted, with part 1 of this project, as a GitHub Repository (so, create a GitHub repository in your **project2** folder). Send me a link to your repository.  If you need help or a refresher with this, please let me know **before the due date**.
