## Class Goal

We will be working together to create a simple Magic 8 Ball Application

## Homework

- Finish the Magic 8 Ball in CodePen.  
    
    - Create at least two additional "Answers".  
    - Style the pen nicely - include a Google Font, some background colors, and an image of a Magic 8 Ball
    - Think of how you can include some CSS transitions and animations to improve this application
    - Send me a link to your completed CodePen before class on Tuesday.

- [Project One](assignments/03-project1.html) is due before the start of class on Tuesday.
