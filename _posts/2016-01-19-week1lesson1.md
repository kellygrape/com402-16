Assignments
-----------

1.  **Sign up** for a [CodeCademy account]
2.  Brush up your HTML and CSS by **completing** the [CodeCademy “About Me” page]. (This might be a little basic but that’s OK, it will be a good review!)  **Email me** when you have completed this. You should send me a link to your achievements page.
3.  Complete the **first lesson **of the [CodeCademy Command Line] track.  **Email me** when you have completed this. You should send me a link to your achievements page.
4.  **Email Me** (kpipe@sju.edu) with your answers to the following.  There are no “correct” answers.
    -   What is your name?
    -   What do you prefer to be called?
    -   What is the best email for me to get in touch with you?
    -   Why are you taking this course?
    -   What do you want to learn in this course?
    -   Do you have a domain?  What is it?
    -   Do you have an example of a website that you have designed that you can share with me?
    -   What do you consider “web design”?
    -   Are you allergic to any foods (sometimes I make baked goods and I don’t want to accidentally poison you)?
