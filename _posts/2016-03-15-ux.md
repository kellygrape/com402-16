## Class Goal

We will be introducing User Experience, some techniques for web planning related to User Experience, and starting an activity.

### What is UX

UX (User Experience) is related to the

- what
- why
- where
- when
- how

of a user's interaction with a product, as well as 

- who

that user is.  The UX describes the user's interaction with a product (or design, or website).

**Examples**

- [Giphy](http://giphy.com/gifs/3NtY188QaxDdC) (view mobile)
- Oatmeal Package

**Bracket Madness**

- Take one section of the NCAA Bracket and pick a final 4 winner by evaluating the websites of each team and choosing the best website.  Pick using your knowledge of usability and evaluating web design
- You should use this version of the bracket to help pick your schools [(bracket pdf)](../media/bracket-ncaa.pdf) - I've added links to the homepages of each school to the names of the schools in the bracket.
- For filling out your bracket, I like [this interactive bracket](http://interactives.indystar.com/sports/NCAA_MBB_Bracket/Lafayette/#)
- Send me your completed bracket section ([you can take a screenshot](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20take%20a%20screenshot%20on%20a%20mac) and email it to me)
- Write a 500-700 word narrative about your Final Four choice, and how you compared your final two schools to arrive at a winner (you don't have to write a narrative about all of your choices, just the last choice leading to your final four contender).  Submit this as a Google Doc or a Word Document.  Due Tuesday, March 22, 2016
