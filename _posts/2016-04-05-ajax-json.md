## Ajax and JSON

We are going to change speed a little bit, and start learning how to access, use, and manipulate data from other websites.


### About APIs

- [What is an API?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) (video)
- [How to use APIs](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube) (codecademy lesson)
- [REST API concepts and examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA) (video)

### Public APIs

- [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
- [Data.Gov](http://www.data.gov/)
- [Any-Api](https://any-api.com/) (offers a testing feature, but many of them don't work as expected)

### Getting Authorized

Many APIs require you to have a developer account / authorization to access their API.  This is common practice, and should be documented by the API you want to access.  You will often receive an **API Key** that is your passcode for accessing the API, which you will use in any code you write to access the API.
