Lesson Plan
-----------

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to answer the following questions:

1.  What is a web server?
2.  What happens when an end user visits a web address using a browser?
3.  How does the file path affect the URL?
4.  Why do we use index.html as a file name?
5.  How can we use the Chrome inspector to help us understand when things go wrong with our site?

All students should also set up an initial folder structure set up that we will use throughout this course.

Node.js
-------

For some of the things we will be doing in this course, we will be using tools built on Node.js.  Download and install Node from the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/).  It does not matter which version you choose, but I recommend the 4.2.5 version.

Assignments
-----------

-   Enjoy your snow weekend.
-   Do you have a web server?  Do you know how to access it (like, can you log in to Reclaim Hosting?).  If you need to renew your hosting account or your domain name, please do so.
-   Web Developers can use FTP to upload files to their server.  Does your host offer FTP?  Can you figure out how to use it?  Do a little research and see what you can discover.  Try to upload our first coding challenge to your server.  Send me an email to let me know how you progressed.
