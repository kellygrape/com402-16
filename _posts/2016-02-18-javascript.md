## Class Goal

We will continue learning about Javascript

## Lesson Plan

### Intro to Javascript

- [First Set of Slides](../media/gdi-intro-js-master/class1.html)
- [Second Set of Slides](../media/gdi-intro-js-master/class2.html)

### The DOM

DOM is short for Document Object Model

- [CSS Tricks' "What is DOM"](http://css-tricks.com/dom/)
- [Short preview of Treehouse's lesson on DOM (auto-playing)](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics/introduction-to-jquery/what-is-the-dom)

We can explore the DOM in Chrome developer tools!

Let's look at the website I created for my sample for [Project 1](../media/project1/index.html) and explore the DOM together.

### Playing with jQuery and Javascript

I've added jQuery to my website.  Let's look at different ways to select elements using jQuery and Javascript.  We'll review the syntax for jQuery and how to include it on your page.

```
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

### Getting jQuery from Google

You can serve jQuery from Google.  Here is a link to the [API page](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery).  Google provides two options - jQuery 1.x and jQuery 2.x.  You can use 2.x if you do not need to support IE8 and below, and if you're not using any libraries that depend on jQuery 1.x.

## Coding Work

Let's make a clock with javascript and jquery!
