##Class Goal

We will be discussing pre-built jQuery plugins.

##This is Cool

##jQuery Plugins

Plugins are scripts that extend the functionality of the jQuery library.  There are thousands of plugins, some good, some bad.

###Finding Plugins

There are lots and lots of plugins out there.  Simply searching for the functionality you want to implement can help you find a number of plugins that you can use.

You need to have some strategies for evaluating plugins.  [Here is a great article about this](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/scriptjunkie/archive/2011/07/11/evaluating-jquery-plugins-for-use-in-your-projects.aspx).  From the article

<blockquote>

- Good documentation and demos - If I can’t figure out how to use your plugin and/or see what it’s capable of fairly quickly I don’t really want to waste my time on trying to figure that out.  The plugin author should be providing at the very least easy examples on what the plugin does.
- Easily downloadable - Seems like a silly requirement but if I can’t easily download the code because of a silly wall in place like having to tweet to be able to get to the code base then that’ll weigh heavily in my determining to use the plugin or not.
- License released under - I should also be able to find what license the plugin is released under.  Ideally it should be listed on the plugin site but if not in the header of the JavaScript file. If a jQuery plugin does not have a license specified I will not consider it.
- Source code available - Most jQuery plugins are released with an open source license, with those projects the code should be available to evaluate.  I should be able to see the full source code, if you are only providing a minimized version then I am unable to evaluate very easily to understand how the code is architected.

A great repository for plugins is [Unheap](http://www.unheap.com/) - here you can sort by use.  This is also a helpful resource for giving you the vocabulary you need to know what you're looking for (for example - what's a **tooltip** or a **lightbox**).

You can also search [Github](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=jquery+plugin&ref=searchresults&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93) for plugins - this is a search for `jquery plugin` sorted by Most Stars.

##Example Plugins

- [Lettering.js](http://letteringjs.com/) "A jQuery plugin for radical web typography"
- [jQuery Scrollpath](http://joelb.me/scrollpath/) Set a cool scrolling path so your content flies all over the screen
- [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) and [Impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/title) - make your own presentations in JS
- [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) - a lightbox script that allows you to zoom images and html content.
- [Full Calendar](http://fullcalendar.io/) - a full sized calendar
- [Formstone](http://formstone.it/) - Lots of different, little UI things
- [Flexslider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/) - A carousel for images


Every plugin is different, and should be implemented according to the instructions the plugin author supplies.  Let's look at implementing Flexslider.


###Assignments

- Walk through this HTML/CSS Form tutorial.  You can do this in CodePen, but you don't need to save it.  Use the knowledge you gain from completing the tutorial to complete this [CodePen Challenge](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/codepen-challenge-2-style-a-signup-form--cms-23678).  **At the very least, you must provide some kind of validation if the form is submitted with an empty email field**. If you use another pen for inspiration (the challenge is over, so there are a lot of different results), write a paragraph below the form about your inspiration and how you implemented your own flavor of it.  Save as a new pen and send the link to me before class on Thursday.
